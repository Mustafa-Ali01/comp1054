        <p>We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down<br>
        I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud<br>
        I couldn't be there even when I tried<br>
        You don't believe it, we do this every time</p>

        <blockquote>
            Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
            Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go<br>
            Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
            Run away, run away
        </blockquote>

        <p>I dare you to do something<br>
        I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame<br>
        Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
        Run away, run away, run away</p>
